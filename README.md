How to use pprobs simulation in python

We want to solve this conditional probabilty problem with python using pprobs simulation in python. 

"Assume that 88% of those who are convicted of theft are actually guilty, and 74% of guilty individuals are found guilty in court, while only 6% of innocent people are convicted in court. If a person is convicted in court, what is the probability that they are actually guilty?"
